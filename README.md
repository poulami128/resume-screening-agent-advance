## Overview
Resume Screening Agent is a Streamlit app that ranks candidate resumes against a job description using embeddings and similarity scoring. It helps recruiters shortlist candidates faster and highlights matched / missing skills.

Key capabilities:
- Upload resumes (PDF / DOCX / TXT) or use sample folder
- Parse job description and extract key skills
- Compute embeddings (OpenAI → sentence-transformers → TF-IDF fallback)
- Rank resumes by cosine similarity and show short explanations
- Export ranked results as CSV

## Features
- Job description parsing and requirement extraction
- Embedding-based ranking with robust fallback
- Resume upload and automated text extraction (PDF/DOCX)
- Skill matching and a short explanation per resume
- CSV export of results

## Architecture (short)
1. Streamlit UI collects JD + resumes.  
2. Preprocessing extracts text (PDF/DOCX/TXT).  
3. Embeddings wrapper chooses OpenAI (if key), then HF, then TF-IDF fallback.  
4. Cosine similarity computes score per resume.  
5. Results displayed with explanations and CSV export.
